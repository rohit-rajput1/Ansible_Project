# Project Overview

[**Ansible Project**](/Ansible_Project.md)

**Ansible Playbooks:**
Define Ansible playbooks for streamlined web hosting, specifying tasks such as package installation, firewall configuration, and server setup.

**Nginx Configuration:**
Utilize Ansible to configure Nginx for serving web content. Define virtual hosts, SSL configurations, and any required optimizations for your specific application.

**Dynamic Inventory:**
Implement a dynamic inventory script or plugin to automatically discover and manage servers. This allows for easy scaling and maintenance.

**Deployment Automation:**
Integrate deployment tasks into Ansible playbooks to automate the process of pulling the latest code from your version control system (e.g., Git) and restarting Nginx for seamless updates.

**Security Hardening:**
Use Ansible to enforce security best practices, such as disabling unnecessary services, configuring secure SSH access, and applying server hardening measures.
