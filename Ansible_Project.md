# Ansible Project

![Ansible Architecture](/Diagram.png)

## What is Ansible?

- **Ansible** is a software tool that provides simple but `powerful automation` for **cross-platform computer support**. It is primarily intended for **IT professionals**, who use it for **application deployment**, **updates on workstations and servers**, **cloud provisioning**, **configuration management**, **intra-service orchestration**, and nearly anything a systems administrator does on a weekly or daily basis.
- **Ansible** doesn't depend on agent software and has `no additional security infrastructure`, so it's **easy to deploy**.

## How Ansible Works?

- **Ansible** works by `connecting to nodes` (**clients**, **servers**, or whatever you're `configuring`) on a **network**, and then sending a small program called an `Ansible module` to that node. **Ansible** executes these modules over SSH and removes them when finished.
- **SSH keys** are the most common way to provide access, but other forms of `authentication` are also supported.

## Ansible Architecture: Nodes and Modules

- **Ansible's Architecture** is based on the concept of a **control node** and a **managed node**. The platform is executed from the control node where a user runs the `ansible-playbook` command. There must be at least one `control node`; a backup control node can also exist. The devices being automated and managed by the control node are known as **managed nodes**.
- **Ansible** automates `Linux` and `Windows` by connecting to managed **nodes** and pushing out small programs called `Ansible modules`. **Ansible** executes these `modules`, which are the resource models of the desired system state, over **Secure Socket Shell (SSH)** by default and `removes` them when finished.
- `Ansible` modules are written in **Python** and can be written in any language. `Ansible` modules are reusable, standalone scripts that can be used by the **Ansible API**, **Ansible Playbooks**, or **Ansible Galaxy**.

## Create **3 Instances** on `AWS EC2` with following names:

- _Ansible_Master_Server_
- _Node_1_
- _Node_2_

### Installation of Ansible on AWS EC2 (Master Node)

```
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```

```
sudo chmod 777 install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

```
ansible --version
```

### Create ssh key on Master Node

```
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen
```

![Screenshot from 2023-08-26 22-05-56](https://github.com/Rohit312001/GitDemo/assets/76991475/c8f07db7-3985-4239-b7d7-36d8ca4d229b)

### What is Hosts file?

- In the context of **Ansible**, a `host file` (also known as an **inventory file**) is a `configuration file` used to define and organize the list of **target hosts** that **Ansible should manage**.

### Where is Hosts file located?

- **Ansible** uses this file to map **target hosts** to **managed nodes**. The **hosts file** is usually located in `/etc/ansible/hosts`.

- So, open the **hosts** file and add the **IP addresses** of the **Nodes**:

```
sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts
```

```
[servers]
Node_1 ansible_host= <Public IP-Adddress of Node-1>
Node_2 ansible_host= <Public IP-Adddress of Node-2>

[all:vars]
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### Now we will ping Node server using Master Node by pasting the public ssh key of Master Node to the Node server.

```
# Open Node_1
cd /home/ubuntu/.ssh
vim authorized_keys
```

```
# Open Node_2
cd /home/ubuntu/.ssh
vim authorized_keys
```

### What is Ansible Playbook?

- **Ansible playbooks** run `multiple tasks`, `assign roles`, and `define configurations`, `deployment steps`, and `variables`. If youâ€™re using **multiple servers**, Ansible playbooks organize the steps between the `assembled machines` or `servers` and get them organized and running in the way the users need them to. Consider playbooks as the equivalent of instruction manuals.

- It allows you to describe the desired state of your `systems` and `applications` in a **declarative manner**, and Ansible takes care of executing the `necessary tasks` to achieve that state.

- Ansible playbooks are written in **YAML**. YAML is a `human-readable data serialization language`. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being `stored` or `transmitted`.

- **YAML** stands for **YAML Ain't Markup Language**. It is a human-readable data serialization language and commonly used for configuration files, but it can be used in many applications where data is being stored or transmitted.

### How to create an Ansible Playbook?

- An **Ansible playbook** is a `structured` and `human-readable document` written in **YAML** (YAML Ain't Markup Language) that defines a `set of tasks` and configurations to be performed on remote servers. **Playbooks are the heart of Ansible automation** and allow you to define the desired state of your systems and applications.

- **YAML Syntax:** `Playbooks` are written in YAML format, which is a `human-readable markup language`. YAML uses indentation and colons to structure `data hierarchically`. Indentation is crucial in YAML to define the `nesting levels of data`.

- **Play:** A `playbook` starts with a `list of plays`. Each play targets a **specific group of hosts** and defines a **set of tasks** to be executed on those **hosts**.

- **name:** A user-friendly name for the play.

- **hosts:** The group(s) of hosts this play will target. Host groups are defined in the inventory file.

- **become:** Indicates whether privilege escalation is required to perform tasks (using sudo).

- **tasks:** List of tasks to be executed in this play.

For Example;

```
---
- name: My First Playbook
  hosts: web_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    # Tasks will be defined here
    - name: Ensure Nginx is installed
    apt:
      name: nginx
      state: present
```

- **name:** A description of the task.

- **module:** The Ansible module to use for the task (e.g., apt, yum, file, copy, etc.).

- **module_arguments:** Arguments specific to the module being used.

### Create a playbook to install Nginx

- **Installing Nginx using Playbook:**

```
-
    name: Installing Nginx using Playbook
    hosts: all
    become: yes
    tasks:
      - name: Install Nginx
        apt:
          command: nginx -y
      - name: Start and enable Nginx
        service:
          name: nginx
          state: started
          enabled: yes
```

### Deploy a sample webpage using the ansible playbook.

```
cd playbook
# Put any index.html file in the playbook folder
sudo vim index.html
```

- Modify the playbook as follows:

```
-
    name: Installing Nginx using Playbook
    hosts: all
    become: yes
    tasks:
      - name: Install Nginx
        apt:
          command: nginx -y
      - name: Start and enable Nginx
        service:
          name: nginx
          state: started
          enabled: yes
      - name: Creating Webpage
        copy:
          src: index.html
          dest: /var/www/html/index.html
```

- **Now we will use the public IP address of the Node server to access the webpage.**

### Node_1 Output:
